# CS:GO Vec2 Class
 A simple class that implements a 2-dimensional Vector into CS:GO VScript, it uses the normal Vector class for computation under the hood (acting like a wrapper) to mentain performance.

## Usage
 This class implements `the exact same` methods(Length(), Dot(), Norm()) and metamethods(addition, subtraction, scaling) as the normal Vector class does, and as such they should be interchangeable.
